        This game modification assignment was about fixing a broken game. A War of Suits is a revamped version of the classic card game, War. Two players will lead an army of either the red or black cards to fight their opponent. On each turn, players will send one of their cards into battle, hoping to beat the value of their opponent’s card. There are many twists and turns when doubles are played against one another, or when an ace shows up to reverse the course of action. The winner of the game is determined by the total score of the players’ victory piles calculated at the end.
